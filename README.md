# Deliverables
--------------------
All documents were created during my time as a Training Specialist at the Center for Deployment Psychology (CDP) from 2019 to 2021.

1) **CDP Second Life Issue FAQ:** I conducted a qualitative analysis of 5 years of post-surveys from Second Life training attendees. I used that data to determine the most common issues attendees encountered, and created the Center's first public-facing support document for the platform. 

2) **Presenting and Sharing in Google Meet:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, CDP gained the use of Google Meet for meetings and trainings, but many subject matter experts were unfamiliar with the platform. This 4-page document was made to bridge that gap using both detailed text descriptions and screenshots.

3) **Google Meet Whiteboard Tutorial:** As comfort with Google Meet rose, some trainers were interested in using the whiteboard functionality in group settings. This 2-page document covers how to open a Google Meet Whiteboard and how to navigate its basic functions. 

4) **Webinar Flowcharts:** A pain point for members of the Center's Online Support Team (OST) was knowing how project responsibilities are typically divided between them and the Project Managers. This flowchart was created to differentiate and organize those responsibilities based on employee role and the platform the training was taking place on (Zoom, Second Life, Adobe Connect). It's also worth pointing out that I'm not a visual designer
